# List of notes, questions, etc.

## Data Management Foundations/Applications: 
CREATE INDEX IndexName ON TableName(ColumnName1, ColumnName2, ...); <br/>
CREATE VIEW ViewName AS SELECT ColumnName(s) FROM TableName WHERE (condition); 

Need to revisit: <br/>
-Subqueries <br/>
-Physical design concepts, especially things like heap tables, sorted tables, etc. <br/>
-Revisit joins


## Hardware and operating systems:
1) How much of the information I'm learning (how OSes function, different storage media types, etc.) will be applicable in a software engineering career? I imagine it's useful, but how much of it should be committed to memory vs. stored in notes I can pull from in the future?
2)

**Need to revisit:** <br/>
Section 2 -- particularly how CPUs work.

**I understand**: <br/>
1) OS terms and concepts like version, source, shell, GUI, network, jobs, event-driven, shell scripts, control statement, process, virtual storage,
2) Most of virtualization.
3) Most of networking (so far - still in this section)
4) Different types of IDEs.

**I sort of understand**: <br/>
1) RAID. I understand RAID 0 is based on striping, RAID 1 is based on duplicating the drives, RAID 5 and 6 are based on some form of parity.
2) RAM. I understand the function of RAM (sort of) and find this to be one of the easier sections to understand, but I have yet to commit to memory the specifications of the different types of SDRAM
3) OS terms and concepts like cooperative and preemptive multitasking, multithreading, 32-bit, 64-bit, x86, x64, ARM, concurrency, kernal,
4) System calls (proces control, file management, device management, information maintenance, communications, protection) and system services (file management, status information, file modification, program language support, program loading and execution, communications, and background services).

**I don't understand**: <br/>
1) CPUs. I understand the Little Man Computer example a little bit, and I can sort of understand some of the terms, but this was one of the hardest sections to understand.
2) OS terms and concepts like long-term/short-term scheduling, time slicing, linker, loader, application programming interface (API), and application binary interface (ABI).

## Scripting and programming foundations:
No real notes so far as much of this class is a review of what I've learned via self study, but I'm excited to finally be "programming" (albeit through Coral) in my SWE degree.
